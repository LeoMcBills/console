Virtual Scanner is an end-to-end hybrid MR simulator/console designed to be easily accessible, modular, and supported by open-source standards.
The project is a response to the ISMRM 2019 Junior Fellow Challenge (Africa).
Virtual Scanner consists of two modes: in Standard Mode, a console-like GUI allows users to perform virtual scans and conduct basic analysis; in Advanced Mode, modular simulation/analysis of the entire MR signal chain may be performed.
